## Features
- Obstacle avoidance using an ultrasonic sensor.
- Reactive LED lighting for visual feedback.
- Programmable logic for autonomous decision-making.
- Compact and durable design.

## Hardware Components
1. Microcontroller:Arduino Uno
2. Sensors: Ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection
3. Power Supply: 9V Battery
4. LEDs: Yellow/Red/Blue for visual effects
5. Chassis: Custom 3D-printed crystal-like design

---

## Software
- Programming Language: Arduino IDE
- Libraries Used:
  - `Servo.h` for motor control
  - `NewPing.h` for ultrasonic sensor integration
- Code Overview:
  The program uses the ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles within 10 cm and triggers a motor response to "run away" in the opposite direction.

## Getting Started
1. Hardware Setup:
   - Assemble the components as per the schematic diagram in the documentation.
   - Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the Arduino using jumper wires.
   - Install the 9V battery pack for power.
   
2. Software Setup:
   - Download and install the Arduino IDE from [Arduino's official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
   - Clone this repository using Git:
     
     git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/CrystalLizardRobot.git
     
   - Open the `CrystalLizardRobot.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.

3. Uploading the Code:
   - Connect the Arduino Uno to your PC via USB.
   - Select the correct COM port in the Arduino IDE.
   - Click Upload to load the code onto the microcontroller.

## Code Highlights
```cpp
// LED Blinking Function
void blinkLED(int pin, int duration) {
  digitalWrite(pin, HIGH);
  delay(duration);
  digitalWrite(pin, LOW);
  delay(duration);
}
